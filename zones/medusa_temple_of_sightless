## 🔥 Summary

You step inside the cracked skull of a goddess who was once worshipped, then cursed, then worshipped again for her rage.  
The **Temple of Sightless Oaths** is a living ruin. Her hair still moves. Her voice whispers lies to statues.

Medusa isn’t your enemy.  
But she will test you until you break.

## 🐍 Terrain + Aesthetics

- Shifting stone tunnels — the hair moves  
- Mirror pools that show player fears  
- Petrified NPCs — some can be revived  
- Echoes of the gods who betrayed her crawl on the ceilings  
- Eye-altars track movement — some explode on eye contact

## ⚔️ Combat

### 📌 Enemies:
- **Oathbiters** — serpentine mobs that punish broken team pacts (e.g. reviving too slow, stealing drops)  
- **Gleamshades** — stealth mobs that freeze players in their guilt  
- **False Champions** — past players turned statue-boss hybrids

### 🧠 Boss Phase: **Medusa Herself**
- **Phase 1:** Mirror Combat — She reflects your weapons  
- **Phase 2:** Sight Collapse — Team must fight blindfolded, relying on audio cues  
- **Phase 3:** Oath Test — She reads your Sin aloud and demands a confession mid-fight

**Win Condition:** Team synergy + confession timing + damage output  
**Lose Condition:** Full team petrification or failed confession
