# Remains Index

The Remains are not roads. They are what’s **left** — torn threads between collapsed domains. You don’t walk them. You’re dragged by what still remembers you.

Each Domain is linked by Remains. Each path reflects the god it fractures through.

---

### 🔥 Ares → Warpath
- Ash-lined, crater-cut corridors still echoing old battles.
- Fights are more frequent here. Faster. Meaner.

### 🐍 Medusa → Gaze Coil
- Petrified statues litter the path.
- Sometimes they breathe.

### 🌹 Aphrodite → Vow Bloom
- Rose-pink light refracts unnaturally in the fog.
- Charm-based enemies. Temptation events.

### 🕰 Hades → Stillgrave
- Death is slow here. Memory loops repeat in fragments.
- You can meet yourself.

### 🍷 Dionysus → Rotvine
- Vines, masks, and broken festival altars twist this path.
- Music lingers. Sanity doesn’t.

## Mechanics Notes

- Each Remain has:
  - Path-specific enemies
  - One traversal event (optional or triggered)
  - Domain bleed effects (if player is bound to a different Sin)

- Up to 5 players can co-exist in a Remain.
- PvE only. Bosses and drops scale with corruption.

More Remains will unlock as new gods and domains activate.
