# CHARACTER CREATION — DIVINEX  
## The Mirror Remakes You

In DIVINEX, character creation is not cosmetic. It’s narrative, irreversible, and soaked in divine consequence. This process begins the moment you’re *Chosen by a Sin* in the mirrorpool/ and carries through your transformation into a bonded weapon of that Sin's will.

## FLOW OF CREATION

### 1. SINFUL CLAIM (See: sin_choice_intro.md)
- Player gazes into the Mirror. One Sin responds.
- The Mirror fractures.
- A Relic and Familiar are spawned, shaped by this Sin.
- The player’s flesh begins to warp, reshape, or bloom.
- **Scene ends with player frozen in shimmering reflection.**

→ Immediately opens **Physical Manifestation Interface**  
(Character customization begins, but it's narrative. The interface is the mirror.)

### 2. PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION

All visual traits react to the chosen Sin. These aren't sliders. They’re *transformations*.

| Trait | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| **Stature/Form** | Lust may elongate or beautify. Rage thickens muscle. Memory erodes edges. |
| **Face/Markings** | Eyes may glow, bleed, or fracture. Cheekbones might be blade-sharp or cracked. Sin-mark runes burn into skin. |
| **Voice Option** | Each Sin offers 2–3 voice types that reflect its mood. Rage is gravel, Envy is whispery, etc. |
| **Aura/Idle Motions** | Aura flickers based on Sin. Body may twitch, float, or drip in idle. |
| **Corruption Trait (optional)** | You may start with a cosmetic corruption: black veins, thorned wrists, blurred edges. This grows with gameplay. |

### 3. ATTUNEMENT SEED

Upon completing appearance:
- Choose your **Initial Attunement Trait** (based on Sin). These are small but matter in early combat.  
Examples:
- **Lust**: "Voice Like Velvet" (Enemies hesitate before first strike)
- **Rage**: "Blood Echo" (Slight resilience regen after being hit)
- **Envy**: "Stolen Stare" (Chance to reflect enemy buff once per battle)

This Trait is **non-refundable**, tied to your Mirror origin.

---

### 4. FAMILIAR BONDING (see: sanctum/sigil_kin.md)
- Your Familiar now finalizes its base form in response to your final appearance.
- Example: Lust-based players might have a serpent with a human face. Rage may spawn a molten wolf.  
Familiar visuals and skills adapt over time based on contracts, battles, or corruption.

---

### 5. STARTING SILKS (Visual Gear)
- You receive your first gear set from silks/
- **Appearance:** Reflects your Sin and faction House, but also suggests origin. These are ceremonial, not armored.
- Players can later strip, modify, or transform silks, but the base version is recorded forever in vault/.

---

## UI STRUCTURE

- **Scene:** The broken mirror pulses in background. Your reflection builds with every option chosen.  
- **Audio:** Sin's voice murmurs as you hover over traits. Echoes of other rejected Sins may hiss or mock.  
- **Confirmation:** Once locked, the mirror **shatters fully** and the player falls forward into their Sanctum’s reality.

## DEVELOPER NOTES

- **Tone:** This must feel ritualistic, irreversible, and intimate. You are not designing a character — you’re becoming one.  
- **Limitations by Sin:** Do not allow full freedom. Each Sin locks or unlocks visual/trait options. Use restriction for drama.  
- **Customization Memory:** Every option chosen should later influence certain scenes or unlock specific enemy interactions.  
- **Replay:** Allow multiple character saves, but each one must be uniquely shaped and remembered by their Sin.
