# CONTRACT SYSTEM — DIVINEX

In DIVINEX, Contracts are not mere quests — they are consequential decisions issued by powerful figures, divine remnants, or corrupted intelligences. Each Contract ties directly into the world’s moral decay, factional tension, and Sin-aligned progression. 

Players accept these missions through narrative devices like the **Wall of Whispers**, **Stone of Consequence**, or directly from high-ranking NPCs. Every Contract has impact — on faction reputation, personal corruption, or the political status of the world.

## TYPES OF CONTRACTS

### 1. Standard Contracts  
**Given by:** House officers, Sanctum officials, lesser divine beings  
**Examples:**  
- Recover a stolen Relic from a contested Remain  
- Destroy a rival House’s Sin node before it completes gestation  
- Escort a Bound Soul across hostile territory  

### 2. Pacts (Unstable, Risk-Bound Missions)  
**Given by:** Divine remnants, rogue spirits, Sins themselves  
**Traits:**  
- Choices often irreversible  
- Failure may increase Corruption or change Sanctum access  
**Examples:**  
- Agree to spare an enemy faction in return for forbidden knowledge  
- Trade part of your Resilience for temporary power  

### 3. Demands (Faction-Wide War Orders)  
**Given by:** Faction leaders, story-gated events  
**Traits:**  
- Tied to world-state changes  
- Often offered to all aligned players in a region  
**Examples:**  
- Launch a coordinated attack across multiple Remains  
- Seize and hold a divine Breach point for 15+ minutes

## CONTRACT ORIGINS

| Origin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Wall of Whispers** | A constantly shifting slate of Contracts — tied to local Remains and minor faction requests |
| **Stone of Consequence** | Displays high-risk, lore-impacting Pacts — only the strongest may accept |
| **Faction NPCs** | Commanders, spymasters, and lore characters tied to House dynamics — they issue repeatable and story-triggered missions |
| **Offering Bowl** | Mysterious, one-off Contracts sent by unseen forces — high-risk, untrackable, limited-time |

## EXAMPLES BY SIN ALIGNMENT

| Sin | Contract Name | Summary |
|-----|---------------|---------|
| Lust | *Crush of Reflection* | Seduce, expose, and humiliate a rival faction officer in public view |
| Rage | *Echoes of Ash* | Lead an unrelenting assault on a node until no enemy remains |
| Envy | *Twin Lies* | Infiltrate a friendly faction and frame another for betrayal |
| Greed | *Silent Weight* | Extract rare resources from a haunted vault, but deliver them to a forbidden collector |
| Memory | *Residual Echo* | Reassemble a broken divine relic by tracking three fading ghost events |

## BRANCHING CONSEQUENCES

Every Contract has multiple outcomes — completion, refusal, betrayal, or abandonment. These change world state or relationships. Examples:

- **Fulfilled pact:** NPC becomes a long-term ally or gives forbidden blessing  
- **Refused demand:** Reputation with your House drops, and Sanctum vendors lock options  
- **Betrayed contract:** Your Sin reacts — by either punishing you with a debuff or marking you for surveillance  
- **Abandoned pact:** Triggers enemy invasion of your Sanctum next cycle

## REWARDS

| Reward Type | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| **Relic Shards** | Used to craft or enhance weapons, armor, or familiars |
| **Sin Marks** | Progression points to deepen alignment with chosen Sin |
| **Faction Influence** | Unlocks higher-ranked missions and Sanctum privileges |
| **Corruption Perks** | Mutated bonuses granted by exceeding Corruption thresholds |

## INTEGRATION WITH WORLD EVENTS

Larger factional changes in DIVINEX are triggered not by story scripts, but by collective contract actions:
- A region’s allegiance may flip if enough Demands are met  
- A Divine Remnant may be resurrected or destroyed based on Pact outcomes  
- Sanctum defenses, offerings, and even visual appearance may change in response to player choices

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES

- All Contracts are fully voiced (planned) or text-based  
- Branching logic tracked per player via Contract Memory Tokens (CMTs)  
- Each file stored in the player’s Relic Vault, where past decisions influence current outcomes
