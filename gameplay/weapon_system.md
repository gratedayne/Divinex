# WEAPON SYSTEM — DIVINEX  
## Arms of Ruin and Revelation

Weapons in DIVINEX are not tools. They are declarations. Manifestations. Cursed inheritance. Wielding one means reshaping your very bloodline.

They are created from divine remnants, Sin essence, or broken relics from a war no mortal survived. They shimmer, bleed, fracture reality, and sometimes whisper.

## WEAPON ORIGINS

### 1. DIVINE RELICS (Corrupted/Recovered)
**Forged by:** Forgotten gods, found in Remains, Ascensions, or corrupted Vaults  
**Nature:** Grand design, damaged purpose  
**Examples:**
- **Shattered Aegis of Valor** — A broken god-shield that can still pulse out concussive force  
- **Elegy Harpblade** — A weapon that plays sound from the last thing it killed  
- **Gilded Gash** — A once ceremonial blade, now rusted, that laughs on critical hits

---

### 2. SIN-FORGED ARMS
**Forged by:** Concentrated Sin crafting or intense alignment with a House  
**Nature:** Living weapons that react to emotion or alignment  
**Examples:**
- **Obsidian Kiss Daggers** *(Lust)* — Charm-based blades that seduce enemies into vulnerability  
- **Gore-Bound Greataxe** *(Rage)* — Increases damage each time you're wounded  
- **The Mimic’s Shard** *(Envy)* — Copies the shape and effects of enemy weapons during battle

---

### 3. RUIN-INFUSED IMPLEMENTS
**Forged by:** Exposure to Ruin zones, corrupted rituals, or failed Contracts  
**Nature:** Unstable, unpredictable, immensely powerful  
**Examples:**
- **Void-Screaming Cannon** — Fires explosive void pulses, but corrupts the user  
- **Tendril-Wrapped Gauntlets** — Grapple enemies, extend damage over distance  
- **Chime of Despair** — Weaponized bell that forces enemy self-targeting

## MECHANICS

- **Attunement:** Weapons bond with user Sin. This influences moveset and hidden effects.  
- **Corruption Load:** High-tier weapons build Corruption over time. Overuse can break the wielder.  
- **Sin Combo Tuning:** Weapon styles change if the user’s Sin alignment spikes or fades mid-fight.  
- **Whispers:** Rare weapons *talk*. This is not cosmetic — voice behavior hints at cooldowns, danger, or betrayal.  
- **Memory-locked Skills:** Certain attacks must be unlocked via boss kills, sacrificed familiars, or Contract completions.  
- **Awakening Events:** Maxing a weapon’s Sin attunement or killing a faction boss may *Awaken* the weapon (new look, voice, moveset, and burden).

---

## UPGRADES

Weapons are upgraded through:
- **Relic Inlays** from vault/
- **Sin Imprints** (earned from Rituals)
- **Flesh Binding** (attaching the soul of a fallen enemy/familiar)
- **Offering Bowl reactions** (non-standard upgrades unlocked by unusual sacrifices)

Visual upgrades may change the entire model, aura, and combat rhythm.

---

## UI & PRESENTATION

- **Vault View:** All weapons are stored in vault/ and are displayed floating, rotating, whispering.  
- **Tooltip Details:** Corruption cost, Sin type, bonded familiar (if any), kills, current attunement level.  
- **Showcase Mode:** Players can share visuals/stats of their weapons at mirrorpool/ and Sanctum events.

## DEVELOPER NOTES

- Every weapon should feel *earned*, not bought.  
- Visual and mechanical identity must match the Sin/House of the player — clashing designs must be temporary or story-bound.  
- Some weapons will evolve depending on the player’s worst decisions.
