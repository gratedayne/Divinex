# RESOURCE GATHERING — DIVINEX

In DIVINEX, resource gathering is no longer passive or peaceful. Every extraction is a calculated risk — infused with corruption, cursed ground, or divine consequence.

You do not "gather" — you Dredge, Harvest, Sacrifice, or Devour. Materials are volatile, spiritually charged, and often alive. This system feeds into crafting, ritual access, weapon upgrades, and aesthetic corruption.

## PRIMARY GATHERING TYPES

### 1. DREDGING (Corrupted Pools, Memory Pits)
**Method:** Use relic tools or mirror-infused artifacts to extract lost remnants from depths  
**Locations:** Forgotten Wells, Womb Craters, Hollow Lakes  
**Examples:**
- *Grief Sediment:* Sinks slowly in time-locked pools. Used for crafting “echo gear”  
- *Reflected Bone:* Only dredged at midnight when your own reflection bleeds

**Risks:**
- Entities may cling to what you retrieve  
- Chance of attracting a Sin Echo or false version of yourself  
- High Corruption spike if dredged with unblessed hands

---

### 2. HARVESTING (Sin-Touched Flora or Blighted Ground)
**Method:** Extract unstable biological matter from hostile terrain  
**Locations:** Glutton Gardens, Red Root Plains, Screaming Orchards  
**Examples:**
- *Bloom of Regret:* Flowers that wilt when seen, regrow when forgotten  
- *Fleshspore Cysts:* Harvested from plant-creatures that scream when torn

**Risks:**
- May infect equipment or familiar  
- Gathering too many may shift your alignment toward Envy or Gluttony  
- Sometimes causes Remains to shift or spawn new enemies

---

### 3. SACRIFICING (Altar-Based Exchanges)
**Method:** Offer collected essence, flesh, relics, or companions for boons  
**Locations:** Scattered altars, faction-aligned Sanctums, corrupted shrines  
**Examples:**
- *Tongue Tithe:* Trade your ability to speak for three in-game hours in exchange for a powerful movement buff  
- *Shard of Self:* Sacrifice one relic to feed another, transferring partial abilities

**Risks:**
- Permanent stat loss is possible  
- Certain altars are fake — they consume everything and return nothing  
- Sacrifice thresholds can awaken hidden Pactlines or bosses

---

### 4. DEVOURING (High Risk / Forbidden Practice)
**Method:** Consume corrupted resources directly to gain unclean power  
**Locations:** Scattered — often hidden or revealed via failed rituals  
**Examples:**
- *Oozing Sigil Fragments:* Eat to gain temporary abilities, lose memory slots  
- *Remorse Crystals:* Boost Sin alignment passively, but reduce party affinity

**Risks:**
- May permanently alter your UI or vision  
- Extreme chance of triggering a Ruin Collapse event in the zone  
- May cause your familiar to turn on you (temporarily or permanently)

## GATHERING RULES & MECHANICS

- Gathering actions may trigger ambient combat or random events  
- Each player has a limited Gathering Stamina, replenished at Sanctums or mirrorpool/  
- Rare materials may scream, glow, or resist extraction — requiring multiple players or rituals  
- Materials are not stackable by default — each holds weight and corruption value  
- Players with aligned Sins may gain bonuses when gathering specific resources

---

## MATERIAL USAGE

Gathered resources fuel:
- Relic upgrades in vault/
- Offering rituals at offering_bowl/
- Custom aesthetic mutations via silks/
- Companion evolution for sigil_kin/
- Faction favor or Sanctuary unlocking

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES

- All gathering types are designed to push risk-reward dynamics  
- World events or faction control may temporarily boost material output or reduce danger  
- Some resources are *sentient* — interacting with players after extraction  
- Devouring introduces permanent narrative shifts — this will be expanded in a future corruption tree
