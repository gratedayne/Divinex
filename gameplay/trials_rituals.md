# TRIALS & RITUALS ‚Äî DIVINEX  
## PvE and PvP Events of Sin, Strategy, and Consequence

DIVINEX replaces traditional minigames with high-stakes Trials and Sin-bound Rituals. These are not diversions ‚Äî they are crucibles of power, corruption, faction warfare, and narrative consequence.

Trials may be instanced or embedded within Remains. Rituals often require group preparation, relic alignment, or rare invitations. Some are faction-gated. Others can only be attempted under a cursed moon.
