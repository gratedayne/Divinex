# TRIALS & RITUALS — DIVINEX

Trials and Rituals are DIVINEX’s answer to traditional “minigames,” but elevated into high-stakes, Sin-infused crucibles. They reward power, prestige, corruption perks, or deeper narrative consequences.

These are not diversions. They are deadly proving grounds, often instanced or embedded within Remains, Sanctums, or contested shrines. Some may occur on timers, under moons, or through rare invitations. Many are faction-specific or Sin-locked.

## TRIAL TYPES

### 1. Trials of Power (Combat)
**Purpose:** Test strength, survival, and tactical prowess  
**Examples:**
- *Ashfall Crucible:* Survive increasingly aggressive Ruin-beasts without aid
- *Grasp of Thorns:* Battle while entangled by a living environment that shifts and chokes over time
- *Shardbreaker:* Defeat a corrupted divine fragment that splits itself into mirrored clones

### 2. Trials of Influence (Deception or Persuasion)
**Purpose:** Manipulate NPCs or players to gain favor, expose secrets, or sway the balance of power  
**Examples:**
- *The Feast of Mirrors:* Convince three faction leaders to betray each other — using only indirect phrases
- *Masks of Lust:* Disguise yourself and perform a corrupted masquerade ritual to seduce a rival’s spy  
- *Eulogy of the Faithless:* Deliver a false sermon convincing a forgotten cult to return

### 3. Trials of Memory (Lore / Puzzle)
**Purpose:** Reconstruct shattered truths, divine echoes, or ruins of identity  
**Examples:**
- *Script of the Forgotten:* Rearrange divine runes in correct emotional sequence before collapse  
- *Last Breath of Envy:* Navigate a silent battlefield using only memory fragments and distorted shadows  
- *Vowkeeper’s Echo:* Replay a House betrayal from 1,000 years ago using incomplete timelines

## RITUAL TYPES

### 1. Sin-Rituals (Group or Solo)
**Purpose:** Invoke blessings, summon nightmares, or shift Sin alignment  
**Examples:**
- *Offering of the Hollowed Tongue:* Sacrifice dialogue options permanently to gain +10 Influence  
- *Skin Communion:* Flay yourself or a party member to attract Lust’s attention — and boon  
- *The Reckoning Brand:* Burn your faction's sigil into enemy soil, alerting the Ruin

### 2. Pact-Rituals (Timed / Region Events)
**Purpose:** World-shifting collective challenges  
**Examples:**
- *Moon of Betrayal:* Once every 8 in-game nights, players can activate a Pact to turn on their faction… and unlock forbidden Remains  
- *Feast of Silent Kin:* Feed unmarked Familiars into the offering bowl to awaken a Sin Titan  
- *The Concord Brawl:* Houses gather in sanctioned arena combat — the winner seizes Sanctum rites for the week
