# 🧩 DIVINEX System Architecture

DIVINEX is a lore-anchored, PvE worldbuilding project structured entirely in modular GitHub files. It’s built for visibility, expansion, and creative credibility — showing that mythology, combat systems, and narrative logic can be organized without prefabs or prebuilt engines.

## 🎮 Core Structure

DIVINEX functions as a standalone, Git-native prototype. All systems are modular. Each script reflects a design choice: ritual over routine, obsession over order, and decay as a mechanic — not a bug.

Every folder is thematic. Every file carries weight. This is not a placeholder repo — it’s the ritual codebase of a mythic world.

## 📂 Folder Guide

### `divinex/game/`
- Main interaction logic
- `intro.py`: Initiates gameplay and scene
- Upcoming: sin selection, loadout memory, affinity tracking

### `divinex/keep/` *(player sanctum systems)*
- Personal base of the marked
- Submodules:
  - `silks/`: Wardrobe and shape
  - `vault/`: Tribute and relic storage
  - `mirrorpool/`: Ritual draw system (cast + pull mechanism)
  - `sigil_kin/`: Myth-creature bond and growth
  - `offering_bowl/`: Item delivery and collected messages

### `world/`
- Divine domains and cross-path regions
- Contains structured region data and path linkage
- Will handle encounters, PvE zones, and collaborative mechanics

### `lore/`
- Written source of Sins, ruin, gods, and systems
- Defines player affliction, divine mechanics, and forbidden influence

### `npcs/`, `dialogue/`, `quests/`
- Narrative scripting zone
- Placeholder folders for nonlinear story logic and triggers

### `docs/`
- Developer-facing structure references
- Contains build map, logic plan, and system documentation

## 🔄 Design Philosophy

- No templates. No repurposed structure. Every name and folder exists because it means something.
- Functional logic mirrors lore — if the gods bind, your code binds. If ruin spreads, so do consequences.
- Modular so any contributor can fork, expand, or execute locally with zero engine required

## ⚔️ Why This Project Stands Out

- Original mechanic-first world: Sins choose players, affinities evolve through behavior, combat is reactive
- GitHub-native build allows total transparency, peer review, and controlled evolution
- Mythological depth without aesthetic crutches — code and concept are equal

> DIVINEX is a combat-coded world with divine logic. You don’t build a UI here. You raise a god.
