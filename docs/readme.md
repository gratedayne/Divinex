# DIVINEX

**Flirt. Fight. Curse. Conquer. You’re divine now. Act like it.**

DIVINEX is a mythcore-flavored, obsession-driven RPG where you play as one of 13 divine-born locked in a collapsing estate built by the gods.  
It’s not about saving the world. It’s about surviving your Sin.

## 💀 THE GAME

You are not chosen. You are *claimed* — by one of the **13 forbidden Sins**:

> Obsession · Betrayal · Envy · Glory · Lust · Memory  
> Rage · Worship · Isolation · Mercy · Power · Blame · Hunger

You enter the **Relic House** — part temple, part battlefield, part social spiral.  
Your Relic speaks. Your Familiar watches. And your choices echo forever.

## ⚔️ CORE FEATURES

- 🎭 **Sin-Based Character Builds**  
  Pick a flaw. It defines your power, social status, and ending.

- 🔮 **Relics That Evolve With You**  
  Each weapon reflects what you ruin — and what ruined you.

- 🐾 **Familiar Companions**  
  Not pets. These are myth fragments, watching your every move.

- 🩸 **Dramatic Combat + Flirt/Rivalry Systems**  
  Fight with blades or emotions. Win with duels or betrayal.

- 🗝️ **Factions: The Houses**  
  Vow. Ash. Coil. Thorn. Each wants you. Not all will survive you.
