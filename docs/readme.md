# DIVINEX

**Flirt. Fight. Curse. Conquer. You’re divine now. Act like it.**

DIVINEX is a myth-blooded, obsession-driven RPG where you play as one of 13 divine-born marked by Sins that change your world.  
It’s not about saving the world. It’s about surviving your own ruin.

## 💀 THE GAME

You are not chosen. You are claimed — by one of the 13 forbidden Sins:  
**Obsession · Betrayal · Envy · Glory · Lust · Memory**  
**Rage · Worship · Isolation · Mercy · Power · Blame · Hunger**

You enter the **Relic House** — part temple, part battlefield, part social spiral.  
Your Relic speaks. Your Familiar watches. And your choices echo forever.

## ⚔️ CORE FEATURES

- 🎭 **Sin-Based Character Builds**  
  Pick a flaw. It defines your power, social status, and ending.

- 🔮 **Relics That Evolve With You**  
  Each weapon reflects what you ruin — and what ruined you.

- 🐾 **Familiar Companions**  
  Not pets. These are myth fragments, watching your every move.

- 🩸 **Dramatic Combat + Flirt/Rivalry Systems**  
  Fight with blades or emotions. Win with duels or betrayal.

- 🗝️ **Factions: The Houses**  
  Vow. Ash. Coil. Thorn. Each wants you. Not all will survive you.

## 🧠 ARCHITECTURE

Built in GitHub to show that worldbuilding, story logic, and combat systems can start with code — not templates.  
Everything in this repo is written for clarity, future expansion, and portfolio visibility.

- No prefab systems  
- No clone structure  
- Every name and file aligns to the world of DIVINEX
