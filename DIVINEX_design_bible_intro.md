# DIVINEX â€” Design Bible Intro

> Flirt. Fight. Curse. Conquer. You're divine now. Act like it.

**DIVINEX** is an original mythcore-flavored RPG where players are claimed by one of 13 forbidden Sins and dropped into a collapsing divine estate fractured by war, betrayal, obsession, and legacy.

It is not about saving the world. It is about surviving what you are.

## ðŸŽ® Game Premise

- Single-player and co-op hybrid RPG
- Set in a dark modern mythos where gods are flawed and power is personal
- Players begin in the **Relic House**, a fragmented divine realm tied to the 13 Domains
- Gameplay blends combat, attraction, rivalry, narrative decisions, and psychological alignment

---

## ðŸ§  Creative Philosophy

DIVINEX is built around the idea that power comes from what ruins you.

This isnâ€™t a morality-based system. Every player is claimed by a Sin â€” Obsession, Lust, Blame, etc. â€” and that flaw defines not only their combat style but their faction options, allies, endings, and relics.

This game rewards intimacy, betrayal, cleverness, and impact. There are no right choices. Just the ones that echo.

## ðŸ”© Core Systems

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sin Alignment** | You donâ€™t choose a Sin â€” it chooses you. Blood into mirror. What cracks decides. |
| **Familiars** | Fragmented godlings that bond with your Sin. They witness your every act. |
| **Relics** | Weapons tied to your downfall. They evolve when you lie, win, or break alliances. |
| **Factions** | The Houses (Vow, Coil, Ash, Thorn) want to use you. You may use them back. |
| **Ruins** | The zones you fight through â€” each godâ€™s broken domain. Not linear. Not safe. |

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure (as of this build)

This design repo includes:

- `/sanctum/` â€“ player base features (outfits, stored relics, companion logs, etc.)
- `/zones/` â€“ files for god/goddess-based zones and Remains paths between them
- `/dialogue/` â€“ opening trials, Sin sequence, familiar bonding, and faction split
- `/factions/` â€“ war history, symbolism, and alliance mechanics
- `/lore/` â€“ original mythos of the Forbidden 13th, divine laws, and Sin relics
- `/gameplay/` â€“ combat system, social mechanics, reward cycle, and alignment tracking

---

## ðŸ§± Game Engine + Tools

- **Engine**: TBD (initial design is engine-agnostic; candidates include Godot and Unreal)
- **Format**: Markdown, JSON, and plaintext to build a clean Git-tracked system
- **Team**: Solo-led IP (writing, structure, narrative, systems â€” Christan Dayne aka @gratedayne)

---

## ðŸ’¼ For Recruiters + Collaborators

This project is being developed as a **public portfolio prototype** to show:

- worldbuilding and system design from scratch  
- command of tone, narrative integration, and gameplay cohesion  
- unique IP development with player psychology as the foundation  
- professional use of GitHub for live design iteration and version control  

**Iâ€™m available for freelance narrative design, worldbuilding contracts, RPG system writing, and creative team roles.** Contact via GitHub or future link.
