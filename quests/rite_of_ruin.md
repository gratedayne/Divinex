After the Rite, you awaken in the **Shrine Loop**, your Relic resting beside you. It now reacts to your Sin and begins whispering.

You may name it.  
You may regret it.

## 🧸 Familiar Unlock

A divine creature is watching from a distance. It enters your room when you don’t look at it directly.

Your Familiar appears based on your choices:

| Player Action | Resulting Familiar |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Submission     | Glim — a silent moth that watches your dreams  
| Resistance     | Fanglot — a sharp-toothed lion cub with a pride problem  
| Twisting       | Mimii — a mimic that steals identities in combat

## ⚠️ Quest Notes:

- This quest cannot be skipped.  
- Dying here does not kill you, but changes your future dialogue options.  
- Certain Relics can only be earned if you **fail** the Rite.
