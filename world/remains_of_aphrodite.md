# 💋 APHRODITE — GODDESS OF WANT  
Remains Zones and Combat Paths

> “She doesn’t make you love her.  
> She makes you love what kills you.”

Aphrodite’s Remains aren’t romantic. They’re psychological. Her Sigils use temptation, mimicry, and guilt. Teamwork here isn’t about trust — it’s about resisting what you want most.
