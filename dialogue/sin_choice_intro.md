# Dialogue: Sin Choice Intro

> **“You weren’t born. You were claimed.”**

You stand in the center of a circle that doesn't touch the ground.  
Thirteen doors surround you. None are labeled. One is breathing.

A voice speaks from behind your ribs. It doesn't ask for your name.

> **“What did you want badly enough that you lied to a god to get it?”**

Three responses float in the air. They do not wait patiently.

- “To be loved first.”
- “To never be weaker again.”
- “To be remembered — even if they hate me.”

As you reach for one, the world doesn’t shift.  
**You do.**

You’re no longer standing.

You are inside the choice you made.

The Rival steps out from the shape of your body. They look exactly like you, but wronger. Sharper. Familiar in the way old wounds are familiar.

They don’t attack yet.

> **“I will wear every version of you that fails.”**
